# Default distribution.  By default, no distribution is defined, and
# the user must specify it with the -d option.  However, a default may
# be configured here if desired.  Users must take care not to upload
# to the wrong distribution when this option is set, for example
# experimental packages will be built for upload to unstable when this
# is not what is required.
